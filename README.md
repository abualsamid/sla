Sample Language Analysis in Python using the NLTK

The purpose of this project is to allow a user to analyze language samples using the Natural Language Toolkit (http://www.nltk.org/)

In order to use this code you must have the NLTK and Python installed. While the NLTK works with both Python 2 and Python 3 we have only verified this code with Python 3.

## Usage

Simply put your text in a folder called data and run

<code>
 python3 main.py
</code>

This will process all text files in the <code>data</code> folder and present Analysis for each file in the folder.
